  This is a "solarized" style for the Kod editor (http://kodapp.com). 
  The palette was developed by Ethan Schoonover 
  (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)*. The 'body' font has 
  also been altered from Kod default.
  
  Currently there is one .css file with the light commented out.
  When you want to switch just comment out the dark, 
  uncomment the light and save, Kod auto reloads when 
  it notices that the file you just saved is the Kod CSS file. 
 
  Copy the file to ~/.kod/mystyle_solarized.css then tell Kod where to find it
  by setting a configuration key:
 
   $ defaults write se.hunch.kod style/url ~/.kod/mystyle_solarized.css
 
  You might need to restart Kod for changes to take effect or 
  select View->Reload style from the menu. Then, simply open
  your ~/.kod/mystyle.css in Kod -- when edited and saved Kod will
  automatically reload the style, thus you see the effect of your 
  alterations.
